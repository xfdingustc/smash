Vdb can be set to non-deleteable.
If set, buffered clips and marked clips cannot be deleted,
and clips won't be deleted when disc is full when recording.
But you can still create new marked clips, create, edit and delete a playlist.

How to set vdb to non-deleteable:

Just before calling avf_media_storage_ready(mpMedia, (int)bTFReady) 
and bTFReady is 1 (request VDB to load), set "config.vdb.nodelete" to 1, 

	if (mb_no_delete) {
		avf_media_set_config_bool(mpMedia, "config.vdb.nodelete", 0, 1);
	}
	avf_media_storage_ready(mpMedia, 1);


VDB:
Now vdb_ack_GetClipSetInfo_t and vdb_ack_GetClipSetInfoEx_t have an extra field
at the tail vdb_no_delete. Please refer to vdb_cmd.h.

Mobile side:
Client side should check the message size to decide if this field exists.
For example,
	if (read_ptr + 4 <= msg_size)
		vdb_no_delete = read_le(4);  // 4 bytes little endian

If vdb_no_delete is set, all clips in the clip set cannot be deleted.
If the client tries to delete any clip, it will fail.
So, client should disable the delete button in this case.

App:
When set to non-deleteable, loop record mode will be useless, so (mobile) app should 
disable this option.
